Here is the current situtation in regards to building the database:
  ##LIMITATIONS
    Alertlabs limits our API usage to 3600 requests/hour (1 requests/second) and to 100mb per device per month (100mb per device / 0.8mb per 30 day minute water resolution = 125 requests per month at a 30 day minute water resolution level)
  ##TIMESERIES DATA
    Further more we have 207 devices (watermeter = 1st gen Flowie / FlowieO = 2nd gen flowie) 
      1. the client list dataframe (131 locations with addtional info) 
      2. for 30 days of minute resolution data per sensor it will be 1441959 byes ot 1.44mb (this is our initial load)
      3. In order to save all of your timeseries data at the MINUTE resolution we will first have to initially load 207 devices * 1.44mb  = 298.08mb of time series data
  ##TOMBSTONE DATA
